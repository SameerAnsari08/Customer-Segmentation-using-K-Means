# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means

This project applies K-Means Clustering for customer segmentation, an unsupervised machine learning technique that groups customers based on similar behavior and attributes. Effective customer segmentation enables businesses to target specific groups more accurately and tailor marketing strategies for improved customer engagement and retention.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

* Performed customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm.
* Conducted detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns.
* Applied feature scaling and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) for better clustering performance.
* Visualized clusters with clear, interpretable 2D/3D plots.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

* Python
* Scikit-learn for clustering and preprocessing
* Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
* Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for visualization

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset contains key customer attributes such as age, income, spending score, and more. It is sourced from public datasets from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhadramohit/customer-shopping-latest-trends-dataset

## ðŸ§  Model Overview

* Used the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
* Applied K-Means algorithm to group customers into distinct segments.
* Each cluster represents a unique customer profile based on purchasing behavior and demographics.

## âœ… Results

The analysis yielded 2 distinct customer segments, each with meaningful insights into customer behavior. These segments can help businesses make data-driven decisions in marketing, sales, and customer relationship management.
